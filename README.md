# Configuration and Setup Swissknife

## Getting started
Clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/L3K0V/dotfiles.git
```

### Initial setup
Before setup the dotfiles maybe would be good to setup the environment.

Go to `scripts` folder

```bash
$ cd scripts
```

First execute `brew.sh`. This will take a while...

```bash
$ ./brew.sh
```

Then install global npm packages

```bash
$ ./npm.sh
```

and atom packages

```bash
$ ./atom.sh
```

### Install

From the root of the cloned folder install and link all configurations

```bash
$ ./install
```
