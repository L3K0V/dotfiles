# .files

## Why?
Before few days I have no idea about managing dot files. In most cases I search and used predefined vim, zsh and other configuration files and try to adjust to them, but one day after reading how these files can be managed with help of some version control system, I decide to try to create my own one, matching my style.

PS. Until yesterday I hated missing of all kinds of aliases and commands shortcuts. But from today new beginning is coming - to create my personal ultimate configuration!

First, backup. And second - easy manage under version control of all .files with all custom configurations plus some scripts for easy setup new environment.

## How to use it?
Just clone and run ```install``` to link all configuration files

### brew

### atom

### osx
